- Give last messages to context of RAG
- Add a feature to set the labels for speakers in the UI
- Add a feature to set the language for transcription in the UI
- Stop the application when a error occurs
- Make the diarization engine with a hybrid approach, with offline refiniment, using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm
- I could also remove, or cluster the speakers that dont have a lot of audio
- Maybe, use some AGC to normalize the audio
- Handle better the errors of audio ingestion, when i remove the main speaker pollutes the log with infinite errors
- Improve the vetorial metadata for diarization, add the speaker id to the metadata, that translates to a speaker label in the UI and the speaker name in the RAG. Do this in a way that i can update the speaker id when i clusterize the speakers in the AHC
- Is a known bug the prints of libraries warnings over the TUI
- Add support for linux, with dynamic support of pyaudiowpatch
- Update README.md with roadmap and screenshots
- Add unit tests
