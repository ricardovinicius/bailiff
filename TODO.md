- Give last messages to context of RAG
- Update to instant diarization engine
- Add a feature to set the labels for speakers in the UI
- Add a feature to set the language for transcription in the UI
- Stop the application when a error occurs
- Make the diarization engine with a hybrid approach, with offline refiniment, using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm
- I could also remove, or cluster the speakers that dont have a lot of audio
- Implement fallback for CUDA not available, use a small model for CPU inference
- Maybe, use some AGC to normalize the audio
